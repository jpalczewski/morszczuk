## What it is?

That application is inspired by many, useful selfhosted webapps(f.e. firefly, wallabag, etc). It's might be also a bit
 related to quantified-self ideas. So, it just to manage things(named here _items_) through locations that can be self-contained(think about box in a box). All items can have a category in order to find something faster. 

## How it is built?

Django 2+ with bootstrap 4+. `Pipfile.lock` and `package-lock.json` have more in-depth information about package. 


## How to use it?

There's a dockerfile that should allow to build image locally, yarn and relatively new python(3.7 works, don't tested other
 versions) is needed.
